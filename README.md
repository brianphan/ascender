# Ascender
Ascender provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is based off the upstream project of [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx).

A separate installer is being released to ease the burden of installing Ascender.
